# Way of Working (According to Essence)

For this lab we consider ourselves to be in the Collaborating state. We started with a meeting where we discussed how to approach the assignment and which tools to use. We also looked at the grading criteria together to make sure we had the same expectations. The work was divided into two parts each, and when questions came up we discussed different solutions before deciding how to move forward. This shows that we are working together and not just completely separately.
However, we are not yet in the Performing state. Even though we collaborate and communicate well, most of the work is still done individually and then combined at the end. In this assignment it became clear that structure is very important to make all parts fit together, and this is something we can improve. To reach the next stage, we need better planning and structure from the beginning and make sure integration happens continuously instead of mainly at the end.
